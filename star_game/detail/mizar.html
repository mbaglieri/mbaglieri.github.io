  The <b>Mizar–Alcor stellar sextuple system</b> consists of the quadruple system Mizar and the binary system Alcor.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mizar</b> (<b>Zeta Ursae Majoris</b>, <b>Alpha&nbsp;UMa</b>, <b>α&nbsp;Ursae Majoris</b>, <b>α&nbsp;UMa</b>) is a quadruple system of two <a href="/wiki/Binary_stars" title="Binary stars" class="mw-redirect">binary stars</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Constellation" title="Constellation">constellation</a> <a href="/wiki/Ursa_Major" title="Ursa Major">Ursa Major</a> and is the second star from the end of the <a href="/wiki/Big_Dipper" title="Big Dipper">Big Dipper</a>'s handle. Its apparent <a href="/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)" title="Magnitude (astronomy)">magnitude</a> is 2.23 and its spectral class is A1V. Mizar's name comes from the <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> <b>مئزر</b> <i>mīzar</i>, meaning a waistband or girdle.)
</p>
<p>
  With normal eyesight one can make out a faint companion just to the east, named <b>Alcor</b> or <b>80 Ursae Majoris</b>. Alcor is of magnitude 3.99 and spectral class A5V.
</p>
<p>
  Mizar and Alcor together are sometimes called the "<a href="/wiki/Horse_and_Rider" title="Horse and Rider">Horse and Rider</a>," and the ability to resolve the two stars with the naked eye is often quoted as a test of eyesight, although even people with quite poor eyesight can see the two stars. Arabic literature says that only those with the sharpest eyesight can see the companion of Mizar. Astronomer Sir <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Moore" title="Patrick Moore">Patrick Moore</a> has suggested that this in fact refers to another star which lies visually between Mizar and Alcor. The name the Arabs used for Alcor was سها (suha), meaning either the ‘forgotten’ or ‘neglected’ one.

  As of 2007, the best estimates of Mizar and Alcor's respective distances place them 1.1 <a href="/wiki/Light_year" title="Light year" class="mw-redirect">light-years</a> apart, and though their <a href="/wiki/Proper_motion" title="Proper motion">proper motions</a> show they move together (they are both members of the <a href="/wiki/Ursa_Major_Moving_Group" title="Ursa Major Moving Group">Ursa Major Moving Group</a>), it was long believed that they did not form a true <a href="/wiki/Binary_star" title="Binary star">binary star</a> system, but simply a <a href="/wiki/Double_star" title="Double star">double star</a>. However, in 2009, it was independently reported by two groups of astronomers (Eric Mamajek <i>et al.</i>, and Zimmerman <i>et al.</i>) that Alcor actually is itself a binary, consisting of Alcor A and <a href="/wiki/Alcor_B" title="Alcor B">Alcor B</a>, and that this binary system is most likely gravitationally bound to Mizar, bringing the full count of stars in this complex system to six.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> These studies also demonstrated that the Alcor binary and Mizar quadruple are somewhat closer together than previously thought: approximately 74,000 ± 39,000 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_units" title="Astronomical units" class="mw-redirect">astronomical units</a> or 0.5–1.5 light years.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  The whole six-star system lies about 83 light-years away from Earth, as measured by the <a href="/wiki/Hipparcos" title="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> astrometry satellite.<sup id="cite_ref-aaa323_L49_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-aaa323_L49-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-aaa474_2_653_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-aaa474_2_653-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-GSM_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GSM-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The components are all members of the <a href="/wiki/Ursa_Major_moving_group" title="Ursa Major moving group" class="mw-redirect">Ursa Major moving group</a>, a mostly dispersed group of stars sharing a common birth, as determined by proper motion. The other stars of the Big Dipper, except <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Ursae_Majoris" title="Alpha Ursae Majoris">Dubhe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eta_Ursae_Majoris" title="Eta Ursae Majoris">Alkaid</a>, belong to this group as well.
